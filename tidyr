1 gather(students,sex,count,-grade)
2 separate(res,col=sex_class,into=c("sex","class"))
3 chain:
# Repeat your calls to gather() and separate(), but this time
# use the %>% operator to chain the commands together without
# storing an intermediate result.
#
# If this is your first time seeing the %>% operator, check
# out ?chain, which will bring up the relevant documentation.
# You can also look at the Examples section at the bottom
# of ?gather and ?separate.
#
# The main idea is that the result to the left of %>%
# takes the place of the first argument of the function to
# the right. Therefore, you OMIT THE FIRST ARGUMENT to each
# function.
#
students2 %>%
  gather(sex_class,count,-grade ) %>%
  separate(sex_class , c("sex", "class")) %>%
  print
4 spread:
# This script builds on the previous one by appending
# a call to spread(), which will allow us to turn the
# values of the test column, midterm and final, into
# column headers (i.e. variables).
#
# You only need to specify two arguments to spread().
# Can you figure out what they are? (Hint: You don't
# have to specify the data argument since we're using
# the %>% operator.

students3 %>%
  gather(class, grade, class1:class5, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  spread(test,grade ) %>%
  print
